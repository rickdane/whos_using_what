===============

This ruby gem provides functionality to perform searches on companies to attempt to determine if they use specific programming technologies such as 'java', 'ruby', 'python', etc.
The development on this is still very much in progress and use cases are still being developed, however the plan is that this will offer a way to determine
 which technologies a given company uses and to also pull in lists of tech-related companies using the LinkedIn API and then determine which technologies these companies use.

As development progresses, documentation with examples and specific uses cases will follow.

Note: To use the LinkedIn API functionality, you will need to have a developer's account with them and supply your own oAuth credentials.
